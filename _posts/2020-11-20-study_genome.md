### Genome Project


In the fields of molecular biology and genetics, a genome is all genetic material of an organism. It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes (the coding regions) and the cnoncoding DNA, as well as mitochondrial DNA and chloroplast DNA.

A genome sequence is the complete list of the nucleotides (A,C,G, and T for DNA genomes) that make up all the chromosomes of an individual or a species.

The first bacterial genome to be sequenced was that of Haemophilus influenzae. A few months later, the first eukaryotic genome was completed, with sequences of the 16 chromosomes of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

A genome sequence: lists the order of every DNA base in a genome
A genome map: identifies the landmarks and is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome.

Noncoding sequences: intron: seuqnece for non-coding RNAs, regulatory regions and repetitive DNA. Noncoding sequences make up 98% of the human genome. There are two categories of repetitive DNA in the genome: tandem repeats and interspersed repeats.

## Tandem repeats

Short, non-coding sequences that are repeated head-to-tail are called tandem repeats. Microsatelli


>A microsatellite: is a tract of repetitive DNA in which certain DNA motifs (ranging in length from one to six or more base pairs) are repeated, typically 5–50 times

>exon: any part of a gene that will encode a part of the final mature RNA produced by that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing.

>A sequence motif: A nucleotide or amino-acid sequence pattern that is widespread and has, or is conjectured to have, a biological significance. For proteins, a sequence motif is distinguished from a structural motif, a motif formed by the three-dimensional arrangement of amino acids which may or may not be adjacent.

>An example is the N-glycosylation site motif:

>Asn, followed by anything but Pro, followed by either Ser or Thr, followed by anything but Pro
